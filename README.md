# U.P.-Crime-Data---Year-2019
Data Visualization of crimes in U.P. for year 2019

This dataset was created for a project at IIT Kanpur and requires preprocessing to visualize the dataset.

The content is crime news articles under the header with "Murder" ,"Kidnapping", and "Crime Against Women" reported by the Times of India site for the year 2019 in Uttar Pradesh. The data is annotated and categorized manually so as to define the reasons and the number of persons invovled.

This data can be used to improve the preprocessing and visuallization skills which corresponds directly to the business research usually done by the big companies to answer many problems. I would like you to see if there exists any relation between the reasons or the crimes committed based on the data.
Using various plots I have analyzed how the how the crime rate is varying in different cities of U.P. and how mens contributes more to the crime, according to this data.
